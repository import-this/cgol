Conway's Game of Life Implementation in Python 2/3

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is
determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One
interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
and observing how it evolves.

Ever since its publication, Conway's Game of Life has attracted much
interest, because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can
evolve. Life provides an example of emergence and self-organization.
